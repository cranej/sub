# What is it

I'm learning Japanese for now. I use `mpd` & `mpc` to play audio files which I extracted from Japanese movies. Often I need to check on the subtitles when I can not listen the current sentence clearly. This tool `srt` plus the helper script `sub`, queries and print the subtitle at the time of current playing audio.

It assumes your subtitle files are at "$HOME/subtitles", and has the same base name of the audio file. However, you can modify `sub` script as your needs.
